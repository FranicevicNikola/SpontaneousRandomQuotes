## We Collect No Personal Information Using Our Application
We do not save, use, collect, or have access to any of your data recorded in Spontaneous – Random quotes for iOS. Individual settings relating to the app are not personal and are stored only on your device. You might also be asked to provide access to your photo library, but this is only so you can save images of your favorite quotes to your library. We don’t process that information at all and have no access to it. We have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone unless you choose to share the image. You might also be asked to allow notifications to be sent by the app. This way the app sends you random quotes.
