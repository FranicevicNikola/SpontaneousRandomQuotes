Spontaneous - Random quotes is an app that generates random quotes. The app currently includes more than 75000 quotes, which you can only discover randomly. Once you find a quote that you like you can save it and display it on your home screen inside a widget. The point of the app is to spontaneously discover new quotes by complete randomness and not by searching for them.

In this app you can:

* Generate random quotes
* Save your favorite quotes
* Share your favorite quotes
* Shake to undo
* Display your favorite quote using a widget

This app is available in the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spontaneous-random-quotes/id1538265374).
